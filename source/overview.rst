Welcome to real_world's documentation!
======================================

This is an overview of the project including its targets and purpose

Purpose:
This program is one built with guidance from the book Python Real-World Projects. The intent of the book is to guide a Python developers through the development of professional grade applications. The developer is not provided complete source code and is empowered to approach the project however they see fit (though suggestions and standards are provided). These projects are great additions to anybody's portfolio. 

Targets:
There will a number of programs created as the developer progresses through the book. My understanding is that each project is an eventual component to an enterprise level app. More will be added here as I obtain more clarity about progressive targets.
